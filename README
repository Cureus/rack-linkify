= Rack::Linkify

== Description

Dead links are magically
transformed into live links! Rack::Linkify is very generous in what it
considers a link; it will turn http://www.google.com, www.google.com, and
just plain google.com into a link.

Rack::Linkify can also turn text that looks like @this into a twitter link.

== Usage

URLs only:

  use Rack::Linkify

Enable Twitter links, too:

  use Rack::Linkify, :twitter => true
